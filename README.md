    <h1>Reclaiming Your Inner Compass: A Proprioception-First Roadmap for TBI Survivors in Calabasas</h1>
    <p><em>Rediscover the silent sense that lets you move confidently through space—even after a concussion or traumatic brain injury turns every step into a question mark.</em></p>

    <h2>1. When “Where Am I?” Becomes Literal</h2>
    <p>
      The morning after my accident I woke up reaching for a glass of water, missed it by six inches, and shattered it on hardwood. That’s proprioception (your body’s built-in GPS) gone rogue. 
      Post-TBI, nerves that once lit up like runway lights can flicker or misfire, making daily movements feel clumsy or downright dangerous. 
      Before we jump into drills, let’s paint a clear picture of what’s happening beneath the skull.
    </p>
    <h3>The Neuroplastic Edge</h3>
    <p>
      Thankfully, the brain is less a static motherboard and more a living city: detours can be built, bridges re-routed, and traffic patterns relearned. 
      The concept is <strong>neuroplasticity</strong>, and proprioceptive retraining is one of its favorite playgrounds.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Ground Rules (Literally): Barefoot Awakening</h2>
    <p>
      Start on safe, soft turf—think yoga mat on carpet. 
      Kick off shoes and let 200,000 nerve endings in your soles collect unfiltered data. 
      Gentle foot rolling on a lacrosse ball can spark dormant mechanoreceptors and prep you for balance work. 
      Two minutes per foot, slow and mindful, is more effective than hammering away for thirty.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Static Stance Progressions</h2>
    <p>
      Begin with feet hip-width apart, eyes open. 
      When you can hold thirty seconds without wobble, close your eyes—the brain must lean on joint feedback instead of vision. 
      Eventually shift to tandem stance (heel-to-toe) and then single-leg stands on a folded towel for gentle instability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Dynamic Weight Shifts &amp; Hip Hinge Patterns</h2>
    <p>
      Controlled hip hinges train posterior-chain sensors and teach the brain where center-of-mass truly resides. 
      Imagine bowing to tie invisible shoelaces, pausing when hamstrings whisper tension. 
      On the way up, squeeze glutes and note how pelvis, spine, and ankles collaborate.

    <h2>5. Neuro-Vision Drills</h2>
    <p>
      Eyes lead motion. 
      Hold a pen at arm’s length, track it right to left, then up and down, keeping head still. 
      Next, keep eyes fixed on the pen while rotating your head side-to-side, then nodding yes/no. 
      Repeat for thirty seconds per plane; reduce speed at the first sign of dizziness.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Cross-Body Patterns &amp; Crawls</h2>
    <p>
      Childhood crawls weren’t just playground fun—they forged neural highways. 
      Revisit them on hands and knees, opposite hand and knee lifting in slow motion. 
      Each diagonal activation forces the corpus callosum to sync hemispheres, refining spatial maps.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Resistance Band Feedback Loops</h2>
    <p>
      Wrap a light band around knees, perform monster walks forward/backward. 
      The elastic challenge tells abductors and glutes exactly “where” they are in space, mitigating knee-in collapse and hip drift.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Single-Task Balance Board Plays</h2>
    <p>
      Balance boards or wobble cushions introduce controlled chaos. 
      Start with micro-shifts: gentle anterior/posterior tilts, then lateral. 
      Avoid phone distractions—multi-tasking too early can overwhelm recovering neural circuits.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Aquatic Proprioception</h2>
    <p>
      Waist-deep water unloads joints while turbulent currents nudge stabilizers awake. 
      Practice narrow-stance marching or gentle lateral shuffles. 
      Water’s viscosity gives instant kinesthetic feedback, reducing fear of falls.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>10. Mindful Yoga &amp; Breath Pairings</h2>
    <p>
      Slow flow sequences—like cat-cow, warrior III prep, or tree pose—layer diaphragmatic breathing onto positional awareness. 
      Each inhale lengthens the spine; each exhale roots the arches. 
      Mind-breath synchronization sharpens vagal tone, easing the anxiety that often shadows TBI rehab.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>11. Measuring Success Without Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      Proprioception gains hide in everyday micro-wins: pouring coffee without slosh, stepping off a curb sans hesitation, standing to put on jeans instead of sitting. 
      Keep a quick journal: <em>“Today I looked over my shoulder while backing the car and felt steady.”</em> Over weeks these anecdotes chart a trajectory that raw metrics can’t capture.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>12. When to Call in the Pros</h2>
    <p>
      If you still encounter vertigo spikes, sudden falls, or visual “lag” after six dedicated weeks, consider vestibular therapy or functional neurology assessment. 
      Calabasas hosts clinicians well-versed in baseline testing, videonystagmography, and targeted neuro-rehab—tools that translate your subjective “off” feeling into data-driven interventions.
